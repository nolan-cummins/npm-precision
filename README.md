This code is designed to analyze the precision of the NPM stage. However, it can also be used to track an reference point moving around the frame of a configurable size. 

Currently, the script runs as many videos as the client PC can handle in parallel, and assumes the reference point to be within a box of width and height 20% that of the frame size, plus 50 pixels in all directions. 

This may or may not change in the future, as it suits my purposes.
